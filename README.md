# rg - Rust Graphics
I wrote this linear algebra library to familiarize myself with the graphics pipeline. It's quite unoptimized at the moment. 

## Novelty
The novelty of this library is that it implements [rotors](https://marctenbosch.com/quaternions/) (instead of quaternions) to represent rotation.

## Credits
Heavily inspired by [`glam-rs`](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs).
